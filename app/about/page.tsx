      <p>
        We are Fūin—a collective of creators admiring the beauty of code and
        design. We craft apps and experiences that blur the line between art and
        tech, exploring illusions, textures, patterns, and colors through
        generative art, typography, and playful type systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission? To spark curiosity and delight with clean, quality work
        that feels alive. We strip away the noise, embracing simplicity as our
        foundation, and let bold ideas shine through precise execution.
